Working for yourself can get lonely and monotone. Here are a few things I do to stay active and inspired.

## Activities

I love doing sports. I’m a very active and sport-hungry person. And I love team-sports. I play Softball for almost ten years now, and I love going to tournaments, compete and have fun with friends. I met my wife through Softball, and I’m very grateful for that.
But even walking my dog is an activity I enjoy most of the time.

Here is a list of my activities during the summer and winter.

- Softball
- Wakeboarding
- Snowboarding
- Mountain climbing
- Indoor jumping
- Inline skating
- Walking my dog

## Inspirations

Before getting my dog, I went to several meetups. It is more difficult now that I own a dog, and she cannot be alone for that long just yet. I always thought about bringing her to one of these meetups. But I'm not sure. I brought her to ElixirConf, and that was good. Let's see.

But since having my dog I go outside more often. I start to enjoy nature a bit more, the silence, the smells (positive and negative), the fresh air.

Although even in the city you can get inspired. Berlin has so much good street art, so many events, I love being back. 
Riding the subway alone brings me joy and relaxes me.

I love to travel. And try to get to as much places as possible I never been before. I'll share my bucket list in a different post soon. 
While traveling, I always try to get to know locals or go to places locals go. I usually stay at an Airbnb and try to get as many insights from the host as possible. I avoid the tourist hot spots if possible.
