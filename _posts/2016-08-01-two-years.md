Wow, I can’t believe it! It’s been two years already. I did it! :)  
Today I’m in business for two years with my company [Civic Vision](https://civicvision.de). I founded the company on Aug. 2014 and am happy to report that we’re still operating and growing every year.

Our revenue grew every year and our profit as well.

I had the opportunity to work with awesome companies and organizations such as Code for America, Open Knowledge Foundation Germany, Worldbank, 18f, Terranodo.

I had fun working on civic tech and social problems. I’m glad I made my passion for civic tech and Open Data to my profession and started Civic Vision in 2014.

I strive to make Civic Vision a success and grow it further. I plan to hire at least one employee this year or maybe next year to support me. It will help me grow even further and focus more on the business side.

Running a business is tough and keeping the cash flowing in. And paying all the bills and your salary is exhausting at times.  But it is fun and energizing. I love working for myself and my clients and make the projects a success for them.

I will continue working on my business and trying out new things. I want to support my family and the community with the work I do.

Thanks for letting me do what I love.
