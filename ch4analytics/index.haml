        %p Mila and I worked together on the CIP Civic Engagement App for the Council Infrastructure Committee with CM Mark Kersey. He proved himself to be an excellent and detail oriented developer with a strong grasp on both the fundamentals of iterative test driven development and automated deployment as well user centric design. He brings a broad range of skills in other areas to the table that would benefit any project or initiative. It was my pleasure to work with him and look forward to collaborating on other projects in the future.
