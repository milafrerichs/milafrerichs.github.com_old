I recently helped a friend move her site away from a hosted really old site to a new one using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.  
It’s now much easier for her to change the site and keep it updated without accidentally breaking anything.   

Using prose.io to update the site is pretty easy even for non-technical people and learning Markdown is not that hard. There are a few tricks you have to show them (like two spaces after the text for a line break) but much better way of changing things than to use Wordpress or an Adobe product to change a few lines of text.  

By using Jekyll and prose I could prevent the overhead Wordpress brings to such a small site and don’t worry about updating the core or touching PHP :)

After a bit of research I found out that it is even possible to add redirects from the old site to GutHub Pages. Take a look [here](https://help.github.com/articles/redirects-on-github-pages).

I’m hoping for the new Jekyll 2.0 to arrive soon since it will bring some awesome stuff. You should [check](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues?milestone=7&state=open) it out.
