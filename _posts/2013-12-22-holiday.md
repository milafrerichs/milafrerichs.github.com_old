Me and my fiancée are on a trip to Russia to visit her family. 
We had to leave early in the morning due to a bad connection to the airport in Düsseldorf. Thanks German railway. :(

I'm not sure how much time I'll have to write another post but I have one cooking that's almost finished. Maybe I can release it while I'm away. We'll see.
