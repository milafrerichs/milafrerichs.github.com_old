I wanted to restart my personal blog for years and did not do it.
But I started reading [Just Fucking Ship](http://justfuckingship.com) and wanted to start shipping. And I thought I start with my blog.
Also, I want to make it a habit of writing every day and it's best to start small and doesn't have the pressure to produce awesome content while developing a habit.

So, therefore, I commit the publish a blog post every day for the next few month.
A few of these blog posts will be about my travels, conference recaps or just about my dog :)

Hope you will like it.
