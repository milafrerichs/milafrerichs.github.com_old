Hello there, I will start blogging from now on and I wanted to write a
short review about what I'll be writing about. The design is not finished yet but
what the heck let's get started.

I will blog about all the development things I will encounter during my days. Most of the stuff will be mapping or data visualization related. But since I work at a rails company it will include some ruby and JavaScript stuff as well.

I love San Diego and contribute to the Code for America San Diego Brigade so there will be stuff about San Diego and civic hacking as well. 

I hope to blog at least every other week. We will see.
