Today I want you to encourage to go to conference and try to meet people especially new ones.  
You will never know what will come out of connections you made years ago.  
Try to follow up with them. Follow them on Twitter, respond to one of their tweets occasionally and they will remember you. Connect on LinkedIn or Facebook, depending how well you got to know them. Follow-up per email, write just a short sentence. That you enjoyed the conversation with them or the topic you discussed got you thinking and share your thoughts with them. They will appreciate and so will you if someone would follow up with you.

I'm guilty of not following up with folks I met at conference or meetups but I should and so should you. 

If you want to find out more about traveling to conferences, a friend of mine from San Diego recently held a [webinar](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/traveling) on this topic. You can find it here:
