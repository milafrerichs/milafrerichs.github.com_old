I went to just a few conferences this year just yet but plan on going to a few more. Conferences are a good way to connect with people, learn more about your craft or other people's business and get in the mindset of learning and speaking/socializing.

[Brennan Dunn](https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/) recently tweeted something which struck a nerve with me, and I regretted not going to [DYFC](https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/euconf/) in Sweden this year. 
But I will go to more conferences next year and a few more business conferences as well, and DYFC 2017 is already on my calendar.

### Previous and future conferences
I will post reviews of each of the past and future conferences I attend but am not there yet.

The previous conferences are:

- [NTEN 2016](https://www.nten.org/ntc/) in San Jose, CA, USA (March)
- [Elixir Conf EU](http://www.elixirconf.eu/), Berlin, Germany (May)
- [TransprencyCamp EU](https://transparencycamp.eu/), Amsterdam, Netherlands (June)

There were a few conferences I wanted to attend but could not. I wanted to go to [Do Good Data](http://www.dogooddata.com/), but I got my puppy Ruby mid-April, and I could not leave her alone at that time.
The same is true for [TICTeC](https://www.mysociety.org/research/tictec-2016/) in Barcelona; I wanted to go but when I decided to go and was sure that my puppy would get cared for there were no tickets available anymore.
[CSVConf](http://csvconf.com/) happened in May, but I had to do a lot of work in May since I took April off to take care of my puppy.
But these conferences are all on my list for next year to attend.

The conferences I want to attend soon are:

- [Barcamp Non-profit](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/barcampnfp-london-august-2016-tickets-26440774067), London, UK
- [FOSS4G](http://2016.foss4g.org/home.html), Bonn, Germany
- [MicroConf Europe](http://www.microconfeurope.com/), Barcelona, Spain (not sure yet)
- [International Open Data Conference](http://opendatacon.org/), Madrid Spain
- [Open Data Insitute Summit](http://theodi.org/panel-discussions/odi-summit-and-awards-2016), London, UK (depends on my vacation schedule)
- [Code for America Summit](https://www.codeforamerica.org/summit), Oakland, CA, USA

If you plan to go to one of these or already booked your ticket: Let's get in touch and connect at the conference.
