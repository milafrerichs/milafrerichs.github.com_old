title: "Monthly Review"
---
This is my first monthly review. That's why it will be not as good as I want. But I will publish a monthly review from now on.
On a different note: I did my first real weekly review today. I thought about last week, cleaned up my stuff. I made a new list of my priorities and the projects I want to work on.  
I cleaned my desk (well worth it). I wrote down my ideas to get more accomplished the next weeks and month. 
I feel magnificent, and I'll commit to doing a weekly review every week. I did put it on my calendar for every Friday. So that's a good thing.

Back to the monthly review.
This is going to be short until I figure out what is important for this review. I'm going to list the things I shipped, how my commitments went, what services I tried out how productive I was.

The most important stuff first.

## Shipping
Listening to "Make money online" talking about "Just Fucking Ship" inspired me to a) buy the book and b) to just fucking ship.
Here are the things I shipped since starting to read the book:

- This blog
- Water quality app San Diego

I have a post for each item I shipped this month.

## Next projects
I have a few ideas about projects I want to tackle the next month. I want to work more on the Water Quality app. And of course, publish new blog articles.
The next bigger thing I want to ship or show you is a visualization of power plants in Germany. The Washington Post did one a few month back, and I worked on the German version back when they published their post. But I never finished it. I will work a bit on it and ship it.

## Productivity
I always try to improve my productivity. Find new hacks and helpers on the way. This month was no different. I went back to use Basecamp for the important (long term) stuff. And it is working out quite well. I use GitHub Issues and Waffle for the day to day things and coding stuff.
I try to use the Pomodoro technique, but I always forget to restart the timer once I take a little break. Not sure what I can do about it.
I used Evernote more and tried to automate as much as possible with Zapier. But there is still room for improvements.

## New Services used
Almost every month I try out new services and apps.
This month I tried out Weekdone but after two weeks I did not use it anymore. I think I will give it another month to try out, but I don't think it will stick.
I added MailButtler for tracking emails, but I'm not convinced yet. But I will give it another month. Not sure I want to pay for such a service, but I think I have to eventually. I'm not sending that many emails I want to track. That's why so far it is not as important to me.
I tried Notion out last week. And I like it very much. It will help with future employers and client on/boarding. Writing SOPs and sharing documents. Let's see.

## Commitments
I committed the week before last week to publish a blog post every weekday and so far I did it. Came close a couple of times but eventually shipped a post.
I wanted to write at least 200 words every day, and this is easier than I anticipated. So far I've written way more than 200 words every day.
Reading is the most challenging and the one I broke at least three times the last two weeks. I need to get better at it.
