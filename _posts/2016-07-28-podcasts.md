title: "Podcasts I listen to regularly"
---
I listen to podcast for a while now. I started with technical podcast like giant robots smashing into other giant robots, ruby rogues, nsbrief, etc.
I love listen to podcasts even about technical stuff. I think I have an easier time listening to something than to read a blogpost. I can listen to them while walking my dog, riding my bike to college back in the days or taking the train.

Since starting my own business in 2014 I listen to more and more business and freelance related podcasts.

Here is the list of podcasts I listen to regularly. You should check them out yourself.

I know that are a lot of podcasts. But I love listening to them. I don't listen to every new episode every week. But I can listen to two to three a day once in a while :)

What podcasts do you listen to? Let me know.
